Instructions to configure the Bluetooth module before connecting it to the robot. HC-05 or HC-06

I'm dealing with the basic bluetooth module, so wires have to be soldered to the module to be used

Use 30 AWG wrapping wire, or annealed copper wire, so you can shape the wires in position and you don't need too many extra hands. 

Connect the module to a source of 3.3V - 3.6V which can deliver at least 150mA. The Vcc and GND of a the FTDI module may not be enough

Connect the FTDI wires GND, RX0 and TX0 to the Bluetooth module, inverting RX0 and TX0, so that:

FTDI    Bluetooth module
GND  -> GND
RX0  -> TX0
TX0  -> RX0

Start the miniterm (or arduino serial monitor), specifying 9600 bauds as the speed (it's the default one set in the Bluetooth)
# miniterm.py -e /dev/ttyUSB0 9600

Copy and paste one by one the commands to setup the bluetooth module, as once connected to the arduino, it won't receive AT commands anymore.
You should not type those commands, as normally it won't work that way. You should get an OK message after each of them. The last one
should be to set the speed to 57600 bauds (BAUD7 from the bluetooth module documentation)
